# Gas3
## ⚠️Attention⚠️
📵Do not use your cell phone while driving. The app does not go into standby. You can view your highscore afterwards. I take no responsibility!

## What is Gas3?
Gas3 is an app that you use while driving, (running or similar <= Soon you can choose what you do. Then the app will adapt to it). It uses gps to find out your speed. You can pick your own music with a filepicker. So I have no problems with copy rights🙂. After that you just start driving and the faster you drive the faster the music becomes. 

At a high speed, an animation appears that makes the speedometer shake.

After that you can look at you highscore. This is your top speed.

## Why is it called Gas3?
The original idea was to take the song [gas gas gas by manuel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atuFSv2bLa8) as background music. This of course did not work because of the copy rights. That's why I decided to take a soundpicker instead of for the song. Since this song was included in the original app idea, the app is called gas3.

## Playstore
I have uploaded the app to the [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=schmitz.florian.gas3)
